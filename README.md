## 📊 Overview

This project aims to understand patterns and trends in the Indian startup landscape by exploring a cleaned dataset of startups.  
Using **Streamlit**, you can interactively view insights and visualisations without writing a single line of code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Processes the `startup_cleaned.csv` dataset for analysis.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for real-time, interactive visualisations.  
- **Funding Insights:** Explore funding trends across industries, cities, and years.  
- **Top Investors & Startups:** Quickly identify the most active investors and highly funded startups.  
- **Filter & Explore:** Select industry verticals, cities, or time periods for focused analysis.
